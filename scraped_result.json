Thats how my Grandpa ate his and Reece and Chris do the same. So, if youre not familiar with chicken fried steak or country fried steak, let me clear up any confusion Why is it called Chicken Fried Steak? Chicken Fried Steak is not made with chicken. Period. No chicken to be found. Its called this because the steak is breaded and fried much like you would a piece of chicken. Chicken Fried Steak is made with cube steak that you find already tenderized at your grocery store. The steak is dredged in a seasoned flour mixture, dipped in a buttermilk and egg mixture and then back into the flour one last time. Finally, its fried to golden perfection and topped with the creamiest, tastiest gravy youve ever tried. Some might even say that the gravy is the best part  Dont Forget the Gravy! There are a few secrets to the best Chicken Fried Steak Gravy. Do NOT scrape the skillet. Leave all of that goodness in there. Simply remove the grease and add back in just enough to make the creamy gravy. Let the flour cook and brown before adding liquids. This builds up flavor and removes that raw flour taste. Slowly whisk in the milk AND cream (yes, I use a little cream in this gravy  ) This keeps lumps from forming and you end up with a smooth, creamy Chicken Fried Steak Gravy. Season at the end. My gravy usually doesnt need any additional salt but I add LOTS of freshly ground black pepper. Now, I go into detail in my instructions below but I want to highlight a few steps here that I want you to pay close attention to before making this recipe. Tips for the Best Chicken Fried Steak Recipe There is no need to deep fry. I shallow fry to golden perfection with a cup of oil  or less. I prefer to use vegetable oil. A heavy skillet works best. I use my favorite cast iron skillet but any large, heavy bottomed skillet will work. Do not overcrowd the pan. EVER. Two at a time is the way to go. Preheat your oven to 225-250F to keep it warm and crispy while youre making the gravy. Buttermilk keeps the steaks nice and tender and the TABASCO Sauce adds loads of flavor without being overly spicy. I make mine with about 2 teaspoons but you can go up to 4 teaspoons if you want to up the ante. I like to keep it relatively calm and my family can add a couple of dashes on top if they like. Youll notice the baking soda and baking powder in the breading. This gives it a perfectly crispy coating that you wont find in other recipes. After breading the cube steaks, really press the flour in. You want the steaks to be completely coated with the breading. Do not flip the steaks more than once. Wait until they are nice and golden brown before flipping. You dont want to disturb that crunchy coating. Refer to the video if you have any more questions or leave me a comment below.

Keyword chicken fried steak, country fried steak Prep Time 10 minutes minutes Cook Time 15 minutes minutes Author Trish  Mom On Timeout Ingredients 4 cube steaks (about 1/3 lb each) 1  cups all purpose flour 2 teaspoons fresh ground black pepper, divided 2 teaspoons kosher salt or sea salt, divided  teaspoon smoked paprika  teaspoon onion powder  teaspoon garlic powder  teaspoon baking soda  teaspoon baking powder 1  cups buttermilk 2 teaspoons TABASCO Sauce (original) 2 eggs 1 cup vegetable oil Chicken Fried Steak Gravy 4 tablespoons grease 4 tablespoons flour 2 to 3 cups whole milk  cup heavy whipping cream salt and pepper to taste Instructions In a shallow bowl, whisk together flour, one teaspoon black pepper, one teaspoon salt, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside. In a separate shallow bowl, whisk together buttermilk , TABASCO Sauce, and eggs. Set aside. Pat cube steaks dry with a paper towel, removing as much moisture as possible. Season with one teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of pepper. Let sit for 5 minutes and pat dry again with paper towel. Dredge the cube steaks in the flour mixture, shaking off excess, then dredge in the buttermilk-egg mixture, letting excess drip off, and then once again in the flour mixture, shaking off excess. Place breaded cube steaks on a sheet pan or metal rack and press any of the remaining flour mixture into the cube steaks making sure that the entire steak is completely coated. Let sit for 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 225 to 250 F. Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a heavy skillet or large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. How much oil you need depends on the size of your skillet. You want it to be about 1/4-inch deep. We arent deep frying the steaks, just shallow frying. Test the oil by dropping a bit of the breading into in. The oil should sizzle and bubble around the breading. Look for the oil to be glistening but not smoking  about 320-340 degrees F. Now were ready to fry. Place two steaks into the pan at a time and fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Do not flip more than once or the breading will fall off. Do not fry more than two steaks or the pan will be too crowded and the breading will fall off. Remove steaks from pan and drain on paper towels. Place in preheated oven. Turn skillet heat to medium. Chicken Fried Steak Gravy Pour the remaining grease into a heat safe bowl or glass measuring cup (I used my Pyrex). Do NOT scrape the skillet clean. We want all of those bits of yumminess to remain in the skillet so they can flavor the gravy. Add back in 4 tablespoons of the grease to the hot skillet. Whisk in flour and continue whisking for two to three minutes or until nice and golden brown. Combine the cream and milk and slowly drizzle in about 2 1/2 cups into the skillet, whisking constantly. It might look a little crazy right at the beginning, but it will all come together. Continue whisking and bring the gravy to a simmer. Cook until the gravy is smooth and creamy, about 5 to 7 minutes. If the gravy gets too thick, add in a little more milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste. (Mine didnt need any salt but LOTS of pepper!) Serve chicken fried steak with gravy and mashed potatoes and your favorite green veggies. ENJOY! Notes Storage Information: Leftover steaks should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
